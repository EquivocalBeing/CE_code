There are three codes for use. Two are seismologial data analysis, while the other is for electromagnetic analysis.


There are two seis codes because one is for data from the Minimus and other is for data from the WebDAQ. The mag code is also for WebDAQ data.

To run the codes, you need to download some additioal packages not installed in standard Python. There is instructions on how to do this and which packages to download in the code.

All three codes are annotated with how to use the code and some additional notes if there is confusion. So, be sure to rtfm.


There is an additional data file to download for the seis codes. This file contains data from a huddle test conducted at LVEA at LHO. This will allow you to compare the data you find out in the field to what is found at LHO.
