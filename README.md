There are three codes for use. Two are for seismological data analysis, while the other is for electromagnetic analysis.


There are two seis codes because one is for data from the Minimus and other is for data from the WebDAQ. The mag code is also for WebDAQ data.
To run the codes, you need to download some additioal packages not installed in standard Python. There is instructions on how to do this and which packages to download in the code.
All three codes are annotated with how to use the code and some additional notes if there is confusion. So, be sure to rtfm.


Additionally, there are LIGO data files. These are so you can compare the field data to what is recorded at ligo. You will need to put these data files in the same directory as the code(s). The code should run with and without the data files downloaded.
